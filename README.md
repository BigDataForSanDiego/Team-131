## NOV 8 (Day 1): Proposal Submission Guidelines
> - Get a markdown template, [proposal_submission_form_2025.md](https://github.com/BigDataForSanDiego/bigdataforsandiego.github.io/blob/master/templates/proposal_submission_form_2025.md), which should be available in your GitHub team repository
> - Customize the template and rename it as README.md to replace the original README.md file **by 4:30 p.m.**

> - For a proposal, please provide us with the following:
>   - Your team name and members
>   - A title for your idea
>   - Hackathon theme it ties to (see list on site)
>   - A sentence describing your idea
>   - A visual that shows what your idea is (can be a sketch, photo, wireframe, etc.)
> - Make sure to think about the Hackathon theme, how this will help the user experience, how data will be incorporated and what problem it aims to solve.
